#### “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.” ― Dr. Seuss, I Can Read With My Eyes Shut!

## Books to Live Your Life By

#### Meditations - Marcus Aurelius
Marcus Aurelius’s diary of sorts. In case you aren’t familiar, Marcus Aurelius was the last good Emperor of Rome. Meditations was written during the last 10 years of his life and reign. It provides a direct look  into the mind of the the most powerful man on the planet circa 170AD. Regardless of the contents of the books, this alone is a marvel. This the  is the power of literature and language at work.

Marcus was not only the pinnacle Stoic (and the last of the important Stoics), but he was one of the wisest and greatest thinkers who ever recorded his thoughts. Meditations is a collection of his own instructions (meant only for himself) on self-discipline, duty, ethics, and  having a philosophy of life.

The best part is that all of his advice is applicable to our lives today. Turns out, human nature and desire haven’t changed much in 2000 years.  The goal of philosophies of life, and certainly the Stoics, is to give us the tools we need to be content and tranquil in our lives and find that tranquility from within, not from achievement or possessions. In other words, these tools give every last one of us a chance at happiness (and to be in charge of that happiness, to boot).

Bill Clinton claims that he reads this book annually, Theodore Roosevelt had this book in his personal library, Benjamin Franklin is said to have had his copy on his night stand at the time of his death, and Tim Ferris calls Stoicism his ‘operating system.’ It is truly one of the most important books on how to live that has ever been written.

I recommend the Gregory Hays translation, which I’ve found by far the easiest to digest. You can get it here. (Not an affiliate link)

#### Tiny Beautiful Things - Cheryl Strayed
If Meditations the perfect book for your mind, then Tiny Beautiful Things is the perfect book for your soul. If Meditations teaches you how to conduct yourself, TBT teaches how to do so with love and compassion.

There is no writer alive like Cheryl Strayed. This book is a collection of letters that she wrote for her advice column ‘Dear Sugar’.  The advice revolves around love, loss, death, mental and emotional health, and family, but this isn’t the worn out advice that you’d expect in these topics. It’s perhaps the wisest and most empathetic  advice out there, and it will make you a better, more emotionally mature person.

More than that though, it will give you a friend. Or rather, a whole bundle of friends that will tell you, when you need it most, “you aren’t alone.” I can’t say it as well as Steve Almond does in the book’s forward:  “We need books, and Cheryl’s books in particular, because we are all, in the private kingdom of our hearts, desperate for the company of a wise, true friend. Someone who isn’t embarrassed by our emotions, or her own, who recognizes that life is short and that all we have to offer, in the end, is love.”

Personally, I own this book in audio, on Kindle, and physically. Whenever I need to talk to that wise, true friend, wherever I am, I can open to any letter and find advice that hits the spot.

These two books are the Yin and the Yang of my personal philosophy of life. They are the best guides I have found to navigating all faucets of life.

#### Setting the Table - Danny Meyer
The lessons learned in this book expand far beyond the restaurant industry. This book is *the* guide on how one should and can treat people. 

If that isn't enough, the book will also show you a case in which treating people the right way transformed a business into the most successful of its kind. 

I can't recommend this book enough for anyone that has to interact with a human at work. (So, everyone.)




## The Rest of the Bunch

#### Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy – William B. Irvine
Like any good school of philosophy, there is a lot to digest in Stoicism.  This book breaks down the tools provided by the Stoics and neatly packages them in bite size nuggets, so that we can use them in our own lives.

Some of my favorite tools taught in this book are self-control and discipline, negative visualization for  gratitude, and insult and annoyance resilience. These practices alone can protect you from most all attempts of the universe to rob you of your tranquility. Towards the end, Irvine even advises us on which tools to master first and how to practice using the tools.

I recommend reading Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, or even Ryan Holiday’s books first,  as they’ll get you excited about what this philosophy has to offer. Beyond that though, this may provide the best way to start your journey toward tranquility today.

#### Letters From a Stoic – Seneca
Like Meditations, this collection of wisdom wasn’t meant for public conception. It’s easy to see why Seneca is perhaps the most famous Stoic thinker.  He’s optimistic and gives concrete advice to his friend on how to live.  While Marcus loathes most of the world’s population, Seneca carries himself in a bright and refreshing way. Seneca was also massively rich and successful, yet resisted ever getting attached to his wealth and fame – making him an ideal beacon for anyone interested in philosophy.

#### When Breath Becomes Air – Paul Kalanithi
It’s hard to find art that can make you so acutely aware of what it is to be human. I can count on one hand the times that someone else’s art has made me so full. (1. The epilogue of this book,  2. this version of Phone Went West by My Morning Jacket,  3. Wallace’s death in The Wire.)

It’s nothing short of breathless to read Paul Kalanithi’s personal account with a terrible circumstance, and how he continued to be the best husband, son, and doctor he could be. It’s a nod to the power of the human condition.

Be warned, though. The inspiration you’ll feel from this book is going to be matched by heartbreak.

#### The Alchemist – Paulo Coelho  
The real deal as far as coming-of-age-Ulysses-like journeys go. This fiction book follows a young shepherd called Santiago who sets out to find something, although he doesn’t quite know what that something is. I think we can all relate.

Before you even begin reading, you kind of know where the book is gonna go. Spoiler alert: what Santiago is looking for was in him all along. Yet, as so many of us experience, Santiago would’ve never learned that without stripping himself of the life he war used to and actually looking. It’s like the old quote: “You have to get lost before you can be found.”

The story is compelling, all the while overflowing with wisdom. That’s what makes it so compelling.

#### Mans Search For Meaning – Viktor Frankl 
You should read this book at least twice in a row to soak it all in. It’s stunning. Viktor Frankl is perhaps the authority on what it is to find meaning in life, and this book chronicles how he was able to find such meaning even as an inmate of Auschwitz.

As you may guess, much of the book is heartbreaking.  But what you may not expect, is that its wildly optimistic thanks to Frankl’s logotherapy, the school of psychotherapy that he developed to find meaning in everything you do.

#### In Defense of Food – Michael Pollan  
Health may be the most important thing to study. After all, you can’t achieve anything, enjoy any pleasures, fall in love, become successful, or be the best at your sport if you’re dead.

That said, I know how much it sucks to be obsessed with working out, counting macros, counting calories, and running on the figurative and literal treadmill. It’s not a fun or sustainable way to live.  I also spent 10 years working in restaurants and studying wine and food,  so eating for pleasure has its place in my life, but that isn’t sustainable either.

So how do we find the intersection between taking care of yourself  and being able to enjoy life without major restriction?

That’s where Michael Pollan come’s in. He makes quite compelling points that eating well is simple. His book expands on the benefits of his main three points: Eat food. Mostly Plants. Not too much. There’s no flavor-of-the-month fad-diet bullshit here.

#### The Obstacle is the Way and The Ego is the Enemy – Ryan Holiday 
These books introduced me to Stoicism. There isn’t a human alive that’s talking about the philosophy to the extent that Holiday does. Both books are easy to digest introductions into major tools in the Stoicism toolbox. They may just be the perfect place to start if you’re looking for a philosophy of life, but they’re also great if you’re into personal development and you need a kick in the pants.



### Other books that I’ve loved recently…  

**The River of Doubt – Candice Millard –** A mind boggling account of Theodore Roosevelt exploring the then uncharted Amazon rain forest.

**Stumbling On Happiness – Daniel Gilbert –** A boatload of insight into the psychology of why we act in a way that makes us think we’ll find happiness.

**Devil in the White City – Erik Larson –** A historical account (written like a novel) of a brilliant mass-murderer at the 1893 World Fair in Chicago. It’s so bizarre that it seems more like fiction. If you like reading novels simply for entertainment, I can’t recommend this enough.

**Wild – Cheryl Strayed –** Again, Strayed is a writer unlike any other. Endlessly wise and insightful.
