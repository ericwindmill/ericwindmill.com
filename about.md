<h1 class='page-heading'> Good development is <em>sweating the details.</em></h1>

#### Hi. I'm Eric. I'm a front-end developer who loves design and user-interaction. I'm devoted to making the web accessible and beautiful for everyone.
<br />

I build web applications that people want to use. My favorite projects are ones that I can see through from the beginning to end. Which is why I've settled on development and design. From brainstorming to designing to prototyping to implementing a usable product, they're all special parts of the creative journey.

I believe in user-driven development and I'm a data freak, but I'm not afraid to instill some soul into a project either. The intersection of userful and interesting is where I find myself at home.

I work with a minimalistic approach. How can I use literal and figurative whitespace in building an application so that it does *exactly* what it should do - no more and no less. The design should be as clean as the code. Feature bloat is the enemy. 

Once upon a time I was a Sommelier, and I still find wine to be the most interesting way to study the world and it's history. I love to read books and I devour music. 

I was born and raised in the wonderful city of Louisville, KY, and I've lived everywhere since. I'm currently calling San Francisco, CA home.
