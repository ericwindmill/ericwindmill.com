### 1990 - Born in the Bluegrass State


### 2009 - 2012 - Graduate University of Louisville - Intro to Logic
Towards the end of my time at UofL, I took a few logic classes. That was when the problem solving wheels started turning.

### 2015 - Sommelier - UX Crash Course 
During the next three years, I lived in many different places helping friends and strangers run resturants. In retrospect, there's not much different between designing a guest experience in a restaurnat and a user expereince on a web application.

### 2015 - 2016 - Fall into WordPress
Motivated to make a WordPress blog tailored to my needs, I took my first step into software development using PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I quickly realized that I didn't want to be pigeon holed into WordPress, so I began to learn Ruby and Rails. 

### 2016 - My First App 
I made a Ruby script that outputs random prompts for daily journaling in different categories (such as Stoicism, Gratitude, and Health).

### 2017 - App Academy - The Deep Dive
The 'bootcamp' lifestyle appeals to me. As does the hack-a-thon weekend. Going all in on one subject to excellerate learning and building. App Academy gave me the foundation I needed to understand how to build full-stack apps. Most importanly, I learned what's actually happening behind the scenes. Writing Rails or React is one thing, understanding is another.
