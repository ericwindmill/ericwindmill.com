<p>Hi. I'm Eric. I'm a front-end developer who loves design and user-interaction. I'm devoted to making the web accessible and beautiful for everyone.</p>
<br />
<p>
I build web applications that people want to use. My favorite projects are ones that I can see through from the beginning to end. Which is why I can't decide between just development and design. From brainstorming to designing to prototyping to implementing a usable product, they're all special parts of the creative journey.
</p>
<p>
I believe in user-driven development and I'm a data freak, but I'm not afraid to instill some soul into a project either. The intersection of userful and interesting is where I find myself at home.
</p>
<p>
I work with a minimalistic approach. How can I use literal and figurative whitespace in building an application so that it does <em>exactly</em> what it should do - no more and no less. The design should be as clean as the code. Feature bloat is the enemy. 
</p>

Once upon a time I was a Sommelier, and I still find wine to be the most interesting way to study the world and it's history. I love to read books and I devour music. 
</p>
<p>
I was born and raised in the wonderful city of Louisville, KY, and I've lived everywhere since. I'm currently calling San Francisco, CA home.
