# Welcome to My Digital Home

Here you'll find [my website](http://ericwindmill.com)

## What's this thing made out of?

This site is made mostly out of good ol' HTML and CSS. A couple of animations rely on Javascript. And finally, I use Jekyll for ease of adding new content.

## Who's this website for?

Well, honestly, it's for me! I love trying new design and annimation tricks out on this website. It's my vanilla front-end playground. It's also for you. If you've stumbled upon the site or my work elsewhere on the internet, this is the best play to get a conversation started.

## Design Inspiration

Right now, I'm going through a big color phase. So you'll see a lot of that. Every once in awhile, I'll come accross a website that's so beautiful it just makes me want to do whatever they're doing. Minimalistic and easy navigation are the constants.

The current iteration of my site (v2.0 official, as of August 2017) is inspired by some sheets that brother had growing up. (And I'm pretty sure most kids had in the 90s.) They featured primary colors and geometric shapes.
