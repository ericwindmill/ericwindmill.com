# Welcome to My Digital Home

Here you'll find [my website](http://ericwindmill.com)

## What's this thing made out of?

The latest redesign of my site was done with [GatbsyJs](http://gatsbyjs.org), which has been an absolute joy to build with. If you like React, check it out. ðŸ˜Ž


## Who's this website for?

Well, honestly, it's for me! I love trying new design and annimation tricks out on this website. It's my vanilla front-end playground. It's also for you. If you've stumbled upon the site or my work elsewhere on the internet, this is the best play to get a conversation started.

## Design Inspiration

Right now at work I'm building a mobile app using Flutter. Flutter is a mobile framework from Google that makes heavy use of Material Design. You'll see a lot of that in v5.0 (current) of my portfolio. Other than that, I tried to go for bare-bones, whitespace, to-the-point design (with a few little quirks).
