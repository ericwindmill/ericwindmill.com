# Welcome to My Digital Home

Here you'll find [my website](http://ericwindmill.com)

## What's this thing made out of?

This site is made mostly out of good ol' HTML and CSS. A couple of animations rely on Javascript. And finally, I use Jekyll for ease of adding new content.

## Who's this website for?

Well, honestly, it's mainly for me! I love trying new design and annimation tricks out on this website. It's my vanilla front-end playground. It's also for you. If you've stumbled upon the site or my work elsewhere on the internet, this is the best play to get a conversation started.
