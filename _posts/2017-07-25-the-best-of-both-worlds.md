Sunday dread. This is what I call the feeling that I used to get at the end of an amazing weekend away from my full-time job. As the feeling sunk in, I began the cycle: struggle through the week. Struggle with the fact that my schedule isn’t my own. Struggle with the bureaucracy and office politics. Struggle with the fact that I simply don’t believe in the project I’m working on. 

Over time, I got to know Sunday dread intimately, because it grows. It isn’t constant, but exponential.

One day, I realized the emotional risk of staying employed was much higher than the financial risk of failing at freelancing, so I made the leap. I quit my last full-time job one year ago this month, and I’ve never looked back. 

Freelancing isn’t all roses and sunshine, though. I spend the first few months cold calling and stumbling through the mess of Freelancing job boards. Pitch after pitch, and the problem: I didn’t even want most of the jobs, but I did want to pay my bills.

That’s one of the bigger issues with freelancing, to me. Getting to do work that is exciting can be hard to come across. How often will I get to work on a product used my millions as a freelancer? Rarely. How ofter will I get to do work for an extremely successful venture? Again, rarely. 

Pretty quickly, I was feeling like the grass was greener on the side I *used* to be on. Where’s the middle, though? Where’s the prairie with the greenest grass  and the sun always shines? Where can I have autonomy and do work worth doing?

**How do I get the best of both worlds?**

It seems the answer is TopTal. TopTal connects its Freelancers to the best projects and the best companies. I can work on the best projects and control my schedule?  This is what I’ve been looking for.

#### Why TopTal?
They screen their freelancers. As a freelancer on TopTal,  have to be able to prove you can do what it is you claim you can do before you can even pitch clients. If you want to be among the best, you have the prove you’re capable of being there.

This also has incredible implications for the clients. Have you ever tried to hire someone on an ‘anything goes’ job board? It’s a nightmare, and you don’t know who to trust. Who can deliver what they say they can? TopTal removes the stress.

The ideal relationship for freelancers and clients is one where trust and communication are abundant and flow in both directions. TopTal does everything in their power to ensure this, which means the relationships will start out on the right foot. 

So, I’m currently going through the interview process to join the Web Programmers Community on TopTal. I’m going TopTal because **I can have the best of both worlds.**
