CSS layout has come a long way. Today, CSS 'frameworks' or libraries just aren't necessary. Standard CSS provides us with ways to make complex layouts fairly easily. The blessing and curse of this is the variety of approaches one can take to create their layout. 

When referring to layout, I'm specifically talking about the size and positioning of different elements on a web page. Heights/widths, padding/margin, and display properties are essentially what I want to address. 

 The secret (and pain) of mastering layout in pure CSS is understanding nuance. Understanding when max-width will have an effect and when it won't is important. Similarly, some elements won't respect margins and some will. You will save yourself so much time and headache if you start to understand these nuances.

## Layout Pre-Requisite: Display, Widths, and the Box Model.

### The Basics
Today, the CSS creators have given us some amazing tools, but once upon a time creating layouts was pretty hacky. But even before those hacks we had really basic webpages, that by today's standard had no layout at all. It was simply 'laid' out like the page of a book. The content flowed from left to right, top to bottom.

Much of the layout cusomization was done by using semantic HTML, and relying on the standard `display` properties of those HTML elements (such as `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block`.

* `display: block` makes an element take up the entire width of its parent element. Therefor no other elements will be on the same line. Block ites respect margins and padding, and can have a width and height. Even when a width is set, the element still forces a link break.
* `display: inline` makes an element take up only the width that it needs, allowing multiple items to be horizontally aligned. These elements respect right and left margins, but not top and bottom, and you cannot set a height and width.
* `display: inline-block` is more or less a combination of the two. It doesn't force a line-break, so elements can sit at it's right and left, but in all other regards it's a 'block' level element.

Perhaps the first step to writing good CSS and semantic HTML is knowing each elements default display style. Here's a non-exhaustive list:
* `block`
  * `<article>`
  * `<aside>`
  * `<body>`
  * `<div>`
  * `<dl>`
    * `<dt>`
    * `<dd>`
  * `<figure>`
  * `<form>`
  * `<h1>` through `<h6>`
  * `<header>`
  * `<html>`
  * `<nav>`
  * `<ol>` and `<ul>`
  * `<p>`
  * `<section>`

* `inline`
  * `<a>`
  * `<q>`
  * `<span>`

* `inline-block`
  * `<img>`

* `none`
  * `<datalist>`
  * `<head>`
  * `<style>`
  * `<title>`

In addition to these, pre-layout web developers organized content using `tables` and `lists`. (While the internet would be a much more boring place if that's what we were still using, it would be refreshing to see HTML that was so semantic.)

Certain CSS properties and 'hacks' can be used with  these standard elements in order to do some basic layout work. This includes manipulating the `margin` (specifically centering using `margin: auto`, and using the `align` property on images and tables (no longer supported)).

In addition to aligning elements, there's nuance in controlling widths and heights of elements. As mentioned, certain elements will respect some of these properties, and others won't. Making sure that your element takes up the proper space is one of the bains of my existence, so let's dive into that.

When thinking about width and height, there are a couple things to consider.
 * How do parent elements (or browser window) affect the width?
 * How does display property effect width options? 
 * Where do you want the item placed?
 * Box-model?
 * Cascades?

Unforuntataely, it's rarely as easy as setting: `width: 100%` and having an element that takes up all available space. And all of the above considerations can also effect positioning.

I'm going to break this down into the most important nuggets, because this could be an entire course on its own.
* Box-Model, Margins, Padding

  * All CSS layout theory is based on the foundation of the box-model. Every element rendered to the DOM is box.  The size of that box is based on the content within the tag + the `padding`, `border`, and `margin`. In the past, this meant that when laying out a page, you had to do math in order to account for the padding and margin of an element. Setting the `width` property simply maniupulates the content width.
  * `Padding` is the space in between the content and the border.
  *  `Border` is the physical border you can put around the conent and padding. Theoretically you can give it as much thickness as you'd like, but its generally not used to add significant size to an element.
  * `Margin` is the property that surrounds the border. I like to think about the element itself being content, border and padding, and the margin being the the elements 'personal' space. It's important to note that in different situations margin may or may not collapse! Check out this example of both collapsing and non-collapsing margins.
  * `box-sizing: border-box` is a property added later to CSS that makes the box-model more intuitive. Remember when I said that I like to think of the element itself as the content, padding and border? That's exactly what the `border-box` fix does. It's used very, very often.

* Width
  * Width is pretty self-explanitroy *at first*. Simply set `width: auto | 10px | 10%` etc, and your element will take that width. 
  * Explicit widths are *super* self explanitory. `10px` is `10px`. No tricks here.
  * Percentage widths are fairly straight forward. You need only consider the percentage of *what?*. The parent element. So a `<div style='width:50%>` nested in a `<div style='width: 500px'>` will have a width of 250px. The only catch is in absolutely positioned elements. The child of an absolutely positioned item will take the width of the <strong>padding-box</strong>. This may sound crazy, but we'll look into positioning more later.
  * `width: auto` is very similar to `width: 100%` except that adding margin will not add extra width, but rather shorten the width of the content. The 100% part refers to the <strong>content</strong> of the element, without regard to its padding, margin, and border.
* Max and Min Width
  * `max-width` and `min-width` are easy enough. And extremely useful.
  * It's first worth noting that these properties override the `width` property.
  * min and max width are both useful when working with responsive layouts. Later, when we talk about flex and grid, you'll see how useful they can be. Essentially, though, elements with % widths will change width based on parent element (or browser window size). But and element that's supposed to be 50% would look ridiculously different on a table compared to large monitor. So you may want the element to stop changing size based at certain sizes. 
* `margin: auto` trick
  * This is a seriously useful trick, but its not without it's issues. Basically, if you give an element a width, and then set its margin to `auto`, it will automatically put equal margin on both the right and left. You just centered an element.
  * This only works on block-level elements. Which makes sense, because an inline element can't be given a width.

### Layout 101: Floats, Table Hacks, and `position`

With a little knowledge of exactly how CSS elements *sizing* works, we can finally get into the meat. How do we manipulate and elements position on a page? With so many different screen sizes and devices, accessibility, and responsive design at play, this question is ultimately not easy. In a boring world where there was only one screen size, you could realistically just use `position` in order to display a page *exactly* how you'd want. (But this isn't a boring world.)

#### `position`

The logical next step in understanding layouts, then, is understanding the `position` property. The position property is basically used to define **exactly** where you want an element to be. Using different values for this property, you can set the position relative to its containing element, or to the browser window. The position element allows you to make something stick to the window, and doesn't respect scroll. It also allows to create complete overlays and cool features like parallax. I use `position` a lot, but with great power comes great repsonsibility.

The values that `position` accetps are:
* static
* relative
* absolute
* fixed
* sticky

* `position: static` is simply the default value. It places the element in the normal 'flow' of the document. I can't think of a reason that you'd ever want to explicity set `static`. 
* `relative` places the element relative to its normal position. Essentially, if you set an elements position to relative, you can now use the properties `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` on it. So you can move it 20px to the left of where it should be by setting `left: 20px`. This isn't what it's most commmonly used for though...
* `absolute` sets the element relative to its first ancestor which is not static. In laymens terms, if you set an element's position to `absolute` and also give it `left: 20px`, it will be painted 20px to the left of its closest ancestor with a `position` that's been explicity set (and not to static) * aside: Most often, you'll see `relative` put on an element simply to act as an anchor for it's absolutely positioned child. Positioning can cause major headaches when you're setting position to `absolute` without first deciphering what the anchor element is. In some cases, you may want a deeply nested element to be positioned relatively to the `body` tag, but that's rare. It usually best practice to position something relative to its direct parent. 
* `fixed` is like absolute, except that it's positioning is always relative to the browser window. so `left: 50px` places the element 50 pixels to the left of the very left of the screen. `Fixed` elements do not scroll with the page. An elemnt that's at `top: 0, left: 0` will stay fixed in the top-left corner. 

The above properties are used often in layouts. Its worth noting that when using positioning you can use values other than `px`. It's also worth nothing that using percentages and `ems` can get tricky with absolute and fixed elements. You've been warned!

The last position property is new, and awesome, but not  widely supported yet. Here's the breif rundown:

#### `position: sticky`

Often websites may want an element to switch between `relative` and `fixed` based on users scroll position. Check out this demo from MDN:

`demo`

The standard way to make this happen is to use Javascript to change the `position` property based on the users scroll position. It isn't necessarily difficult, but it does take a bit of know-how. `sticky` basically implements this for us.

As of writing (August 2017), this feature is supported in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Edge (16 only), and iOS Safari. It has no IE support. [Complete support list](http://caniuse.com/css-sticky/embed/)

Checkout my entire post and demo of `position: sticky` here.

#### `translate: transform`

The last useful nugget with positioning that I want to throw in is using `transform: translate()`. You may have used `left` or `top` in the past with a positioned element and found something about it annoying. If you wanted to, say, get an element directly in the middle of the page, you'd have to do math. If you set `left: 50%` the element *begins* at the 50% mark. In otherwords, it's left most border will be placed at 50%. So now you have to do some calculations (either manually or using `calc()`) to make the center or the image positioned in the center of the parent element (or window). 

Or, you can use the `transform` property with the `translate` function as its value. Both `transform` and `translate` have many usecases, and I'd encourage you to checkout everything you can do with `transform`. But translate simply moves an object based on x and y axis. So `transform: translate(10px, 10px)` moves the x starting position of the forward 10px, and the y starting positon forward 20px. You can also use percentages with transform, and the percentages are relative to the *size of the element*. So a 10px x 10px div thats been translated `(-50%, -50%)` would be the same as translating it `(-5px, -5px)`. No more math with percentages and positioning.

(Okay, you may have to do some math, but not for this specific, but common need.)
