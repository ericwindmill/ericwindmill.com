## What the heck is Grid?

<!-- * CSS Grid Layout is the newest and hottest layout tool in CSS. -->
<!-- * Its used to control how items are laid out over two demensions (where as flexbox only lets you control one). -->
  <!-- * Grid allows you to control columns and rows, not one or the other as flexbox does. -->
  <!-- * However, Grid is designed in a way that if you have a single row or column, it behaves much like flexbox. -->
  <!-- * Infact, many of the properties used to control Grid are similar to those in flexbox. -->
<!-- * Supported in all Major Browsers as of March 2017. Checkout [CanIUse](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid)
* Grid is another step forward in creating complex layouts that can be made responsive rather easily.
* One advantage to Grid is that you can write semantic and soundly structured HTML, and then lay it out visually using CSS, giving you the best of both worlds.
* Grid basically took the idea of the HTML table layouts, but makes it work without using hacks.

* Grid is, essentially, the layout system that is designed to be a *full* layout tool. I've not yet used it to create a full layout system, but I'm certainly using it on much larger sections in a webpage. -->

# 1: Terminology and Basic Concepts:

There a fair bit of terminology that needs to be understood. They're terms easy, but important.

Grid Container - The container is the parent element. It could be a <code>div</code> or perhaps a <code>section</code>. This is the element on which the <code>display: grid<code> property is applied. All of a containers immeditate children are grid items.

```html
<dix class='grid-container'>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
</div>
```

Grid Item - All immediate children of a 'grid container' are 'grid items' that are being manipulated by the Grid.

```html
<dix class='grid-container'>
  <div class='grid-item'></div>
  <div class='grid-item'></div>
  <div class='grid-item'></div>
</div>
```

Gird Line
Grid lines are the lines that make up a grid. The run vertical and horizontal <em>between</em> the grid items. They are referred to by number in the grid system. These lines are <strong>important</strong>, because we place grid-items by which lines they start and end at, not which track they're on.

Grid Track
Grid tracks are the spaces between the lines. The tracks are where our actual content lives. These can also be horizontal or vertical. They're basically columns and rows in your grid.

Grid Cell
This is a single space in the grid, between two horizontal lines and and two vertical lines. A cell is one space.

Grid Area
An area is like a cell, but can span multiple columns and rows. It can take up as many cells as you'd like.

Grid Gutters / Gaps
<code>grid-gap</code> is an actual property, but it defines what I like to think of as 'gutters'. Gutters are spaces between cells. In a less abstract explanation, it literally puts space between your grid items.

# Defining a Grid

Defining a grid is just like defining a flexbox. <code>display: grid</code> defines the grid container. Unlike flexbox, we have to do a bit more to make it act like a grid.

The two other properties that all grids should have are <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code>. These properties allow us to set the number and size of your columns and rows.

The CSS for this is quite simple:

.flex-container {
  display: flex | inline-flex;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 50px 100px;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
}

In this example, I defined 3 columns that are 100px each. You can think of this as your grid. The values represent a column track width. The space inbetween (and around) represents a grid line. (And the same goes for rows). With this grid definition, you'll end up with a grid that has 4 vertical lines and 3 horizontal lines.

<code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code> take any units that any size property in CSS could take.

Absolute:
<code>px</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>pt</code>, etc
Relative:
<code>percentage</code>
<code>vh</code> / <code>vw</code>
etc...

In this Codepen below, you can input whichever values you want for <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code>. See how easy it is to set explicit grid track sizes.

There's also a unit that's been introduced specifically for grid called the <code>fr</code>. We'll take a look at that next...
