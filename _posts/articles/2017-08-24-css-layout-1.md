## Layout 101: Floats, Table Hacks, and Position

With a little knowledge of exactly how CSS elements *sizing* works, we can finally get into the meat. 

How do we manipulate and elements position on a page? With so many different screen sizes and devices, accessibility, and responsive design at play, this question is ultimately not easy. In a boring world where there was only one screen size, you could realistically just use `position` in order to display a page *exactly* how you'd want. (But this isn't a boring world.)

### Position

The next step in understanding layouts, then, is understanding the `position` property. The position property is basically used to define **exactly** where you want an element to be. Using different values for this property, you can set the position relative to its containing element, or to the browser window. The position element allows you to make something stick to the window, and doesn't respect scroll. It also allows to create complete overlays and cool features like parallax.

The most important thing to remember about positioning is that it changes the flow of the document. If you position something absolutly or fixed, it's removed from the normal flow and basically sits 'above' (in z-index) the rest of your content. So, if the content around the element changes, the element itself won't 'reflow'. And vise versa. 

<img src='http://res.cloudinary.com/ericwindmill/image/upload/c_scale,w_600/v1503687483/blog_posts/Screen_Shot_2017-08-25_at_11.23.27_AM.png' style='margin:auto;display:block;' height='300px'>

The image above shows two different ways of laying out a simlple name-tag div. The first column uses `floats`, and second absolute positioning. The only difference between the top and bottom nametags is that the `img` width has been changed from `100px` to `120px`. (Nevermind floats or the funky boarders shown above, focus on the image and its relation to the text.)

In the second column, the images have been taken out of the flow of the document using absolute positioning, so when the image is resized, it has no affect on how other elements behave. Thats the 10 second version of what 'document flow' is.

The values that `position` accetps are:
* static
* relative
* absolute
* fixed
* sticky

* `position: static` is simply the default value. It places the element in the normal 'flow' of the document. I can't think of a reason that you'd ever want to explicity set `static`. 
* `relative` places the element relative to its normal position. Essentially, if you set an elements position to relative, you can now use the properties `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` on it. So you can move it 20px to the left of where it should be by setting `left: 20px`. This isn't what it's most commmonly used for though...
* `absolute` sets the element relative to its first ancestor which is not static. In laymens terms, if you set an element's position to `absolute` and also give it `left: 20px`, it will be painted 20px to the left of its closest ancestor with a `position` that's been explicity set (and not to static) * aside: Most often, you'll see `relative` put on an element simply to act as an anchor for it's absolutely positioned child. Positioning can cause major headaches when you're setting position to `absolute` without first deciphering what the anchor element is. In some cases, you may want a deeply nested element to be positioned relatively to the `body` tag, but that's rare. It usually best practice to position something relative to its direct parent. 
* `fixed` is like absolute, except that it's positioning is always relative to the browser window. so `left: 50px` places the element 50 pixels to the left of the very left of the screen. `Fixed` elements do not scroll with the page. An elemnt that's at `top: 0, left: 0` will stay fixed in the top-left corner. 

The above properties are used often in layouts. Its worth noting that when using positioning you can use values other than `px`. It's also worth nothing that using percentages and `ems` can get tricky with absolute and fixed elements. Basically, if you're using dynamic sizing properties on elements that aren't in the flow of the document, it can get really ugly on different sized screens when mixing positioned elements with other layout forms..  You've been warned!

The last position property is new, and awesome, but not widely supported yet. Here's the breif rundown:

#### `position: sticky`

Often websites may want an element to switch between `relative` and `fixed` based on users scroll position. Check out this demo:

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="KvxdOz" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ericwindmill" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Position: Sticky basics" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/ericwindmill/pen/KvxdOz/">Position: Sticky basics</a> by Eric Windmill (<a href="https://codepen.io/ericwindmill">@ericwindmill</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

The standard way to make this happen is to use Javascript to change the `position` property based on the users scroll position. It isn't necessarily difficult, but it does take a bit of know-how. `sticky` basically implements this for us.

As of writing (August 2017), this feature is supported in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Edge (16 only), and iOS Safari. It has no IE support. [Complete support list](http://caniuse.com/css-sticky/embed/)

Because this feature isn't widely supported, I won't go into to much, but you basically just need to set `position` to `sticky` and give it another paramenter. In the above example I do this by setting `top` to `-1px`. I think this will account for 99% of future use.

#### `translate: transform`

The last useful nugget with positioning that I want to throw in is using `transform: translate()`. You may have used `left` or `top` in the past with a positioned element and found something about it annoying. If you wanted to, say, get an element directly in the middle of the page, you'd have to do math. If you set `left: 50%` the element *begins* at the 50% mark. In otherwords, it's left most border will be placed at 50%. So now you have to do some calculations (either manually or using `calc()`) to make the center or the image positioned in the center of the parent element (or window). 

Or, you can use the `transform` property with the `translate` function as its value. Both `transform` and `translate` have many usecases, and I'd encourage you to checkout everything you can do with `transform`. But translate simply moves an object based on x and y axis. So `transform: translate(10px, 10px)` moves the x starting position of the forward 10px, and the y starting positon forward 20px. You can also use percentages with transform, and the percentages are relative to the *size of the element*. So a 10px x 10px div thats been translated `(-50%, -50%)` would be the same as translating it `(-5px, -5px)`. No more math with percentages and positioning.

(Okay, you may have to do some math, but not for this specific, but common need.)

### Floats

The first tool added to CSS specifically for creating better layouts was the `float` property. Assigning any element the `float` property keeps it in the flow of the document and pushes it against the `left` or `right` of the containing element, depending the value you give it. The above CodePen that uses 'name-tags' uses floats. It was originally designed to wrap text around tables and images, but developers being developers, they found ways to make it much more powerful. Floats can be used realistically to make entire web layouts.

Let's start from the beginning.

The `float` property accepts the following values:
* `left`
* `right`
* `inherit`

The values are pretty straight forward. A left-floated element sticks to the left of the page, a right to the right, none is default, and inherit makes the element take the value of its parent.

#### Clear

You can't talk about floats without including `clear`. This property is used to control how other elements interact with floated properties. If you add `clear: left` to the next sibling of a property that's been floated to the left, the sibling will be forced to a new line if the element above is floated to the left. If the element is floated to the right, you can use `clear: right`, and `both` clears no matter what the float value from the previous element. 

The `clear` property accepts:
* `left`
* `right`
* `both`

<p data-height="427" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="ayjYpJ" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ericwindmill" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="IceCreamPigFloats" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/ericwindmill/pen/ayjYpJ/">IceCreamPigFloats</a> by Eric Windmill (<a href="https://codepen.io/ericwindmill">@ericwindmill</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

The biggest problem comes into play when an element's size (usually height) is greater than it's containing element. Consider the original use of floats, wrapping text.

Let's look at a previous example:
<img src='http://res.cloudinary.com/ericwindmill/image/upload/v1503687483/blog_posts/Screen_Shot_2017-08-25_at_11.23.27_AM.png' style='margin:auto;display:block;' height='300px'>

Pay attention to the left column now. Even though the reflow is great, the image is now taller than the containing div.

If the height of the text is less than that of the image, the image will bust out of the element. There are a couple ways to avoid the issue of clearing. The first, and best way is to simply use `clear`, but that only works if you know forsure what the next element it going to be, and if the page is more or less static. Here's a couple hacks:

* `overflow: hidden`
  * Setting the parent elements overflow to hidden does cause it expand to the height of the floats. Which is quite nice, but it can trigger unwanted scrollbars or hidden content depending on the browser. So it requires a lot of testing.
* `clearfix` hack
  * When I first got into CSS, before the flexbox days, some clever people came up with the `clearfix` hack. This hack has gone through a number of iterations in attempt to be supported by all browsers. It's an ugly hack, but a user would never know that the CSS was hacky, so its often used. 

This is the most modern verstion, and is supported by IE8 and up. 
```css
  .item:after {
    content: '';
    display: table;
    clear: both;
  }
```
This is the go-to hack at this point. It simply adds a tiny bit of content *after* the element, whos content is an empty string, so it's invisible. Empty string content isn't supported by older browsers,so you may have to add aditional properties for that. 

Here's the same image with a clearfix applied:

<img src='http://res.cloudinary.com/ericwindmill/image/upload/v1503688159/blog_posts/Screen_Shot_2017-08-25_at_12.08.53_PM.png' style='margin:auto;display:block;' height='300px'>


Floats come with quite a bit of 'gotchas' that are always hard to forsee, but not so hard to fix. It's always almost possible to acheive what you want, but you usually have to sarifice semantic HTML.

The good news is that you *never* have to use floats if you don't want to anymore. This was the first attempt at a powerful layout tool for CSS, but life is much better now.


### Table Hacks

In CSS2, we were given the ability to add `table` properties to any HTML container element. Which changed the game for CSS Layout. 

Essentially the table properties allow you to do what HTML table tags already could do. The compelling thing about having them as CSS properties (rather than HTML tags) is that we can use JavaScript (and Media Queries) to dynamically change the css properties to make interestesting and responsive layouts.

Here's a very simple example of using `table-cell` to make a row of columns. Toggling the button changes the elements from `display: block` to `display: table-cell`.

<p data-height="239" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="QMVWBW" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ericwindmill" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Table Layout pt 1" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/ericwindmill/pen/QMVWBW/">Table Layout pt 1</a> by Eric Windmill (<a href="https://codepen.io/ericwindmill">@ericwindmill</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


#### Advantages over Floats

The first big advantage here is equal height divs. Sizing elements properly is kind of nightmare when you're starting out with CSS layouts. It arguably gives me the most pain in the world of web development. Using tables for layout solves this problem with ease. Naturally, if you have a containing element set to `display: table` and the children set as `display: table-cell`, the cells automatically expand to fix the height of the table. It's a pretty sweet and easy way to solve this problem. 


<p data-height="344" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="mMGyyg" data-default-tab="result" data-user="ericwindmill" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Table Layout Pt 2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/ericwindmill/pen/mMGyyg/">Table Layout Pt 2</a> by Eric Windmill (<a href="https://codepen.io/ericwindmill">@ericwindmill</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


You're probably starting to see how useful this would be to create layouts. Consider for a second that you needed a standard blogging layout: Header, Main section w/ a sidebar, and a footer. You could easily contol the layout of the main section and the sidebar with a `table` and `table-cell`s.

There are additional `table` rules that make this even more compelling. If you've ever worked with HTML tables, each different tag has a corresponding CSS property. 

``` css
{display: table} /* <table> */
{display: table-row} /* <tr> */
{display: table-header-group} /* <thead> */
{display: table-row-group} /* <tbody> */
{display: table-footer-group} /* <tfoot> */
{display: table-cell} /* <td>, <th> */
```

 

There area few more table properties, but these are the most important for layout. As you can imagine, you can use `table-header-group` and `table-footer-group` to manipulate a layout header and footer. So essentially, you can just wrap your page in a giant table and call it a day.

Thats not all. It's pretty damn easy to imagine how you could use media queries with table to make a responsive layout. Just look at that first codepen about tables. Remove the `table-cell` property under a certain screen size and boom, you've got a stacked layout perfect for mobile.

So right now you're probably pretty stoked. But unfortunately (and fortunately) we have to talk about why you wouldn't want to use tables for layout. 

#### The 'Gotchas'

* The first and most important: Using a table layout makes like hard for users with screen-readers. If you aren't worried about accessibility, there's an issue.. Semantic HTML matters and best practices matter.
* Page load times are generally slower. Tables usually require a bunch of markup. 
* Tables make redesign much harder. You're basically locked into using that table, or doing a complete redesign.

The HTML 5 spec says: 
 > Tables should not be used as layout aids. Historically, many Web authors have tables in HTML as a way to control their page layout making it difficult to extract tabular data from such documents. In particular, users of accessibility tools, like screen readers, are likely to find it very difficult to navigate pages with tables used for layout. If  a table is to be used for layout it must be marked with the attribute role="presentation" for a user agent to properly represent the table to an assistive technology and to properly convey the intent of the author to tools that wish to extract tabular data from the document.


### The Next Steps

So there we have it, folks. A simple intro into the CSS Layout tools of the past. Another title for this post could be 'Building a foundation so you can understand the tools you actually want' As you'll see in the next posts, CSS3 layout made a huge jump with Flexbox and Grid. They have a higher learning curve, but once you know them, they're super powerful.
