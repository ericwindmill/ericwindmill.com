# Elefant Job Proposal

Our first conversation left me with a lot to think about, but it solidified three things that I thought:
* I believe in the product.
* I want to work for *you*. I believe in you. I believe in your ability to start a company, and I believe you're a genuine and nice human being.
* I want to work at a startup. (More on this later.)

I was left looking for a number of answers. Particularly:
* What can I contribute? What *can't* I do. 
* What about this role is appealing?
* What exactly should I expect from a job at a brand new company, and what should they expect from me? Am I willing to give that?
* And so many more...

The truth is, working for a brand new company is much more responsibilty than working as an engineer at Facebook. So, I want to present everything extremely honestly and forthright, because you have a lot at stake here.

In otherwords, I found myself actually caring about wether or not I can help your company, rather than looking at it selfishly. 

I've been mulling it over quite a bit, and this is what I've come up with.

## The Work
The most pressing matter from the business's viewpoint for me is to understand 
* How I can contribute.
* Where my knowledge gap lies.
* Why am I right for this role.

The first thing I did after our conversation is research where my knowledge gap is. And, I realized, there isn't much of one (for what's needed right now). 

Here's a picture I made in Sketch:

![My Tech Skills]()

####*Disclaimer: This is a very inaccurate representation of an application technology stack, but it proves a point.*

I won't go into a long technical speil, but I'll break that down into the five high-level categories:

1. Design and UI
  * I'm not a graphic designer. But I do *love* design and UI. 
  * I'm well versed enough in Sketch and Adobe Suite to make wireframes and mockups.
  * I'm an expert on coding up all things UI and Design (JS/HTML/CSS/SVG/DataViz)
  * Until you need some serious logo and branding (aka a marketing department), I can hold down the user-interface. (And would love to do so).

2. Front-End
  * Along with UI, this is where I'm most comfortable.
  * JavaScript, React Native, Redux, etc. I got this.
  * If you wanted to build a true native app, I'm confident I could learn Swift quickly.

3. Back-End
  * I know Ruby / Rails well.
  * I could learn Python / Django, or Node or whatever I needed to learn. No problem.
  * I'm comfortable with both SQL and noSQL databases.
  * All in all, I would say that I absolutely can do this, but there are certainly people out there who could do it quicker.

4. Hosting and Tooling
  * I've used Heroku, some AWS tools, and some Google Platform tools. (There are pros and cons of each... but thats another conversation for another day...)
  * I'm ignorant to the process of getting an app into the App Store. 
  * It'd be nice to have someone with tons of experience, but these are all things I know I could learn with relative ease.
  * I'm fully trained in using all modern code-writing tools like Git and Github. 

5. DevOps
  * DevOps is more or less the process of making sure that a team of hundreds of engineers can contribute to a code base without screwing anything up.
  * That's as far as my knowledge goes. I'm aware of a few prodcuts that handle this for you, but thats it.
  * **but** DevOps are generally not on the radar of a brand new company. They don't need to be.
  * That said, someone with system design expereince would be a benefit in the long term. 

That's the long version of what I can and cannot contribute to your team. I thought a bunch about what the ideal situation looks like for Elefant (and one in which I'm in the picture...)

I think from the jump I would be accompanied by a strong back-end engineer. Many teams have way bigger back-end teams than front-end teams. I think having one back-end engineer and one fullstack engineer (me), would allow us to get the product finished, and done well, very quickly. Of course, 3 engineers would be the absolute best starting position, but it ain't a perfect world, huh?

Again, I don't think DevOps are super important at this time, so someone who has experience in Node and AWS would be the perfect compliment to my skills. Of course, any seasoned backend engineer could pick up whichever backend language we chose, so the Node experience is only a bonus. (By the way, Node is my vote for backend. But, I digress...)

Having two engineers would of course cost more than having one. There are the average salaries in San Francisco for various engineer roles (accordingto Glassdoor):
* Front-end Engineer: 105,000
* Software Engineer: 110,000
* Full-stack Engineer: 115,000
* Back-end Engineer: 132,000
* Senior Software Engineer: 139,000
* Senior Front-end Engineer: 145,000

I don't think I have to tell you that these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, but they do seem to be pretty on par with what's expected at tech companies in the Bay Area. I don't know if you're ready to start talking numbers, but this should give you some rough insight into what a 2 person team costs in SF.

### The Plan
This is rougly a high-level view at how I foresee the first few months going.

#### Week 1/2: 
* Help you find the second engineer
* Technology research
* wireframes, planning, etc.

I've learned the hard way that planning something for 2 weeks will save you 2 months in the long run. 

#### Month 1:
Build a prototype. For all purposes, this would be the first version of the app. All minimum viable product functionality would work, there would be some user-interface and styling, but not so much that it isn't easily changeable after doing some UI-user testing.

#### Month 2/3: 
Month 2 is the month of getting the prototype ready for its first release. It would involve UI testing, code testing, and jumping through all the Apple hoops. 

I'm not entirely sure of how much time / work it takes to get the app into the App Store (on Apples end), but barring any limiting circumstances from them, I believe we could have a finished Elefant v1 in 90 months from start date. I've build usable web apps in much quicker time (like 3 weeks), but that doesn't include UI testing, building for scalability, etc.

(This is a good time for an aside: I'm constantly referring to scalability, which is important. However, the running advice in Silicon Valley is more or less: 'If scalability has become an issue, its a good problem to have.' Or in otherwords, don't worry about it, because you aren't going to have 10,000 users in a week.)

#### Beyond: 
After the first version is out, I'd like to focus on improvements until the user-feed back is good. Then, when we feel comfortable about V1, we can start looking into adding features. Beyond the first release is hard to predict, in my opinion.

## What Else Can I Offer (Beyond Technical Skills)


## Why do I want to Work Here? 

### Why Do I Want to work here?
* I want to learn more about running a business. I want to help out in a bunch of different places.
* I like Autonomy
* You're British. My family is there.
* Your trust in my ability to decide where I can and can't help (and tell you honestly) tells me that you're someone that I want to associate with, learn from, and work for.

### What else can I offer?
* I build Pig and Poet from scrath, so I know what it takes.
* I have expereince with content marketing.


### Other Notes
* You kept saying that you feel differently about engineers than other positions.
  A. I agree, because it is a highly technical skill. Energy can't make up for lack of knowledge.
  But B. This is why I don't want to work in the engineering department at Google. I enjoy thinking about concept and UI and highlevel product, I want to work somewhere that I can have that conversation
