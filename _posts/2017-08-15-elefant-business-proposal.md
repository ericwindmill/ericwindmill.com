Hey Nick, 

Our first conversation left me with a lot to think about, but it solidified three things that I was already thinking about:
* I believe in the product.
* I want to work for *you*. I believe in you. I believe in your ability to start a company, and I believe you're a genuine and nice human being.
* I want to work at a startup. (More on this later.)

I was also left with some things that weren't quite solidified. Particularly:
* What can I contribute? What *can't* I do. 
* What about this role is appealing?
* What exactly should I expect from a job at a brand new company, and what should they expect from me? Am I willing to give that?
* And so many more...

Working for a brand new company is much more responsibilty than working as an engineer at Facebook. So, I want to present everything extremely honestly and forthright, because you have a lot at stake here.

I've been mulling it over quite a bit, and this is what I've come up with.

<div class='seperator post-seperator'></div>
## The Work
Obviously, it's important for me think about this job from your business's viewpoint.
* How I can contribute?
* Where does my knowledge gap lie?
* (Why) Am I right for this role?

The first thing I did after our conversation is research where my knowledge gap is. And, I realized, there isn't much of one (for what's needed right now). 

Here's a picture I made in Sketch:

![My Tech Skills](http://res.cloudinary.com/ericwindmill/image/upload/v1502843617/edmodo/my_tech_skills.png)

*Disclaimer: This is a very inaccurate representation of an application technology stack, but it proves a point.*

<div class='seperator post-seperator'></div>
I won't go into a long technical spiel, but I'll break that down into the five high-level categories:

1. Design and UI
  * I'm not a graphic designer. But I **do** love design and UI. 
  * I'm well versed enough in Sketch and Adobe Suite to make wireframes and mockups.
  * I'm an expert on coding up all things UI and Design (JS/HTML/CSS/SVG/DataViz)
  * Until you need some serious logo and branding (aka a marketing department), I can hold down the user-interface. (And would love to do so).

2. Front-End
  * Along with UI, this is where I'm most comfortable.
  * JavaScript, React Native, Redux, etc. No worries there.
  * If you wanted to build a true native app, I'm confident I could learn Swift quickly.
  * Although, I came accross this yesterday... "Companies using React Native".
  ![Companies using React Native](http://res.cloudinary.com/ericwindmill/image/upload/c_scale,w_400/v1502843631/edmodo/Screen_Shot_2017-08-15_at_2.25.10_PM.png)

3. Back-End
  * I know Ruby / Rails well.
  * I could learn Python / Django, or Node or whatever I needed to learn. No problem.
  * I'm comfortable with both SQL and noSQL databases. (So all databases).
  * This is, however, where my expereince starts to fall.
  * **All in all**, I could do this on my own, but there are certainly people that could do it quicker.

4. Hosting and Tooling
  * I've used Heroku, some AWS tools, and some Google Platform tools. (There are pros and cons of each... but thats another conversation for another day...)
  * I'm ignorant to the process of getting an app into the App Store. 
  * It'd be nice to have someone with tons of experience, but these are all things I know I could learn with relative ease.
  * I'm fully trained in using all modern code-writing tools like Git and Github. 

5. DevOps
  * DevOps is more or less the process of making sure that a team of hundreds of engineers can contribute to a code base without screwing anything up.
  * That's as far as my knowledge goes. I'm aware of a few prodcuts that handle this for you, but thats it.
  * **but** DevOps are generally not on the radar of a brand new company. They don't need to be.
  * That said, someone with system design expereince would be a benefit in the long term. 

That's the long version of what I can and cannot contribute to your team. I thought a bunch about what the ideal situation looks like for Elefant (and one in which I'm in the picture...)

The reason I said that I believed there was a bigger knowledge gap than there was, is because I thought companies had large system-design and devops teams from day one. That isn't the case. 

I think from the jump I would be accompanied by a strong back-end engineer. Many teams have very large back-end teams and just a front-end engineer or two. I think having one back-end engineer and one fullstack engineer (me), would allow us to get the product finished, and done well, very quickly. (Of course, 3 engineers would be a dream, and 4 would be better than that, etc...)

Again, I don't think DevOps are super important at this time, so someone who has experience in Node and AWS would be the perfect compliment to my skills. Of course, any seasoned backend engineer could pick up whichever backend language we chose, so the Node experience is only a bonus. (By the way, Node is my vote for backend. But, I've digressed...)

### Costs

Having two engineers would of course cost more than having one. There are the average salaries in San Francisco for various engineer roles (according to Glassdoor):
* Front-end Engineer: 105,000
* Software Engineer: 110,000
* Full-stack Engineer: 115,000
* Back-end Engineer: 132,000
* Senior Software Engineer: 139,000
* Senior Front-end Engineer: 145,000

I don't think I have to tell you that these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, but they do seem to be pretty on par with what's expected at tech companies in the Bay Area. I don't know if you're ready to start talking numbers, but this should give you some rough insight into what a 2 person team costs in SF. 

### The Plan
This is a rough, high-level view at how I foresee the first few months going.

#### Week 1/2: 
* Help you find the second engineer
* Technology research
* wireframes, planning, etc.

I've learned the hard way that planning something for 2 weeks will save you 2 months in the long run.

#### Month 1:
Build a prototype. For all purposes, this would be the first version of the app. All minimum viable product functionality would work, there would be some user-interface and styling, but not so much that it isn't easily changeable after doing some UI-user testing.

#### Month 2/3: 
Month 2 is the month of getting the prototype ready for its first release. It would involve UI testing, code testing, and jumping through all the Apple hoops. 

I'm not entirely sure of how much time it takes to get the app into the App Store (on Apples end), but barring any limiting circumstances from them, I believe we could have a finished Elefant v1 in 90 days from start date. I've built usable web apps in much quicker time, but that doesn't include UI testing, building for scalability, etc. So the real timeline would reflect how polished we wanted the application to be.

(This is a good time for an aside: I'm constantly referring to scalability, which is important. However, the running advice in Silicon Valley is more or less: 'If scalability has become an issue, it's a good problem to have.' Or in otherwords, don't worry about it until you need to. There's a really good blog post on it here: )

#### Beyond: 
After the first version is out, I'd like to focus on improvements until the user-feed back is good. Then, when we feel comfortable about V1, we can start looking into adding features. Beyond the first release is hard to predict, in my opinion.

## What Else Can I Offer (Beyond Technical Skills)
* The first restaurant that I managed I joined before conception, and when I left I was the GM. This is what I learned:
  * How to roll with the punches. It was a brand new place, which meant we we're figuring out a lot along the way. 
  * I constantly had to be willing pivot and solve unforseen issues.
  * I learned that in a new business, you do many more jobs than whatever it is you were hired to do.
* I have expereince with content marketing.
  * This is an asset because that's something you'll be facing. While I don't this I'd be able to devote time to content marketing, I at least give informed opinions and insights.


### Other Notes


<div class='seperator post-seperator'></div>

## Why Do I Want to work here?
As promised, these are some quick reasons of why I want to work at a startup.
* I want to learn more about building a business. 
* I **enjoy** wearing a bunch of hats, having too much work to do, and generally helping out wherever I can.
  * I really don't want to work in job where I spend 12 hours a day coding. There is so much more involved in creating a product, and I want to be a part of all of that. 
* My motivation is directly correlated to how much impact I can have.
* You said multiple times that hiring engineers is different than other positions.
  A. I agree, because it is a highly technical skill. Energy and hunger can't make up for lack of knowledge.
  **But** B. This is why I don't want to work in the engineering department at Google. I enjoy thinking about concept and UI and highlevel product, I want to work somewhere that I can be part of the larger conversation. In that regard, I do think my energy and hunger is a asset.

And, why Elefant? Why you? Etc.
* Like I said, I like the product.
* I want to build something that makes sense to me conceptually.
* I genuiely believe in you as a human being.
* You're British. My dad is from London and much of my family still lives there. I have an inclination toward English people.
* Your trust in my ability to decide where I can and can't help (and tell you honestly) tells me that you're someone that I want to associate with, learn from, and work with.
