# July Goals

Of course, there are a million things I'll be working on every single day. I like to set 3 explicit goals to smash overwhelm. The goals usually fall along the lines of improving health, improving programming/design skills, and improving my career.


## 1. Finish MVPs for Live Tonight app
## 2. Climb 20 times
## 3. Speak at One Meetup
