<!--Taking on More is Dangerous-->
<!--Why do I take on more?
  -To Prove MySelf
  -To beomce the best.
-->
<!--The better way
  -I have nothing to prove.
  -Say no to take care of youself
-->

Society rewards those of us who have the 'go it alone' and 'never stop grinding' mentalities. I struggle  with the feeling that I could always be doing more. 

This feeling is so much stronger in me now that I'm a recent bootcamp grad. I feel like I'm at the bottom of the pile, and I have to fight my way out. I have an incessant desire to do more, more, more and prove that I'm cabaple. 

### But What do I Have to Prove?

I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I imagine I'm not the only one who feels like they have to prove their value through their work. In my mind, I know how dangerous this is. I know how wrong this is. I know where my value <em>actually</em> comes from, and it isn't from a resume, an impressive portfolio, or a bank account.

This is why I say 'yes' to everything. But, is it the best way?

If I spend 16 hours a day working on my career and boosting my resume, I'll end up miserable. I will have forsaken so many other things that make me happy: friends, family, health and hobbies. The classic cautionary tale is Steve Jobs. Sure, he created something unbelievable, but wasn't he more or less miserable? Didn't he push away everyone he loved? Is it worth it?  

The best humans find balance. Sure, the top 0.01% at a particular craft probably isn't balanced, but they're likely lacking in other areas. It's easy to logically understand this, but it's another thing entirely to convince yourself to live this way.  

My long term goal is to find the balance. I believe that to be among the best, I have to not only grow the skills, but also be a content human being. 

### The Power of No

Today, I woke up and quit an internship opportunity before it began. I said 'no'. 

It wasn't easy. I hate saying no. I hate admitting that I can't do more. Until I stop and ask myself these questions: 'What do I have to prove? Who do I have to prove it to?'  The (sad) truth is that I'm only trying to prove my value to myself. Everyone else believes about me what they want, and I won't change that by working myself into a hole.

But, I did it. And, honestly, it felt amazing. It's the feeling that you get when you know you made the right choice in your guy. It's weight off your shoulders, or a looser collar. 

This is the power of no. It's the power to control your own life. If you're a 'yes' person, give no a try. 

It isn't fun feeling like you're letting people down. It sucks admitting to yourself that you just can't handle more. But in your gut, you know when you've betrayed your own good-will for the wrong reasons. That intuition is trying to tell you something. Listen to it.

### Because that's the real golden rule: You can't lie to yourself.
