## Books to Live Your Life By

### Meditations - Marcus Aurelius
Marcus Aurelius was not only the pinnacle Stoic, but he was one of the wisest and greatest thinkers who ever recorded his thoughts. Meditations is a collection of his own instructions to himself on self-discipline, duty, ethics, and  having a philosophy of life. This is *the* guide on how to live.

### Tiny Beautiful Things - Cheryl Strayed
If Meditations the perfect book for your mind, then Tiny Beautiful Things is the perfect book for your soul. If Meditations teaches you how to conduct yourself, TBT teaches how to do so with love and compassion.

Cheryl and those who write into her become a whole bundle of friends that will tell you, when you need it most, “you aren’t alone.” I can’t say it as well as Steve Almond does in the book’s forward:  “We need books, and Cheryl’s books in particular,because we are all, in the private kingdom of our hearts, desperate for the company of a wise, true friend. Someone who isn't embarrassed by our emotions, or her own, who recognizes that life is short and that all we have to offer, in the end, is love.”

### Setting the Table - Danny Meyer
The lessons learned in this book expand far beyond the restaurant industry. This book is *the* guide on how one should and can treat people.

If that isn't enough,  the lessons in this book are wrapped up in the true story of how one man changed the restaurant industry through the power of simply following the golden rule.  I can't recommend this book enough for anyone that has to interact with a human at work. (So, everyone.)
