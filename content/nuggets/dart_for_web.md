description: "Dart is a language built at Google used to create apps with Flutter (mobile) and AngularDart(web). Dart is currently used by massively important teams at Google such as AdWords. Dart team's goal is making 'the best client side language in the world' or in other words: a JavaScript competitor. With the impending release of Flutter beta, you can still get in before it becomes super in demand."
