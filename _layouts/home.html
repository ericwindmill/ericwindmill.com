          <p>
            Form follows function. A beautiful software experience is about connecting the 
            guest to the content with the least resistance possible. I thrive on creating these holistic 
            experiences with careful planning, scalable technology, and intuitive design.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Louisville in 2012, where I studied social sciences and language. I'm currently living in San Francisco, CA.</p>
        <p>I spend my time making tools that I want to use, reading books, and devouring music. I used to be a Sommelier, and I still find wine to be the most interesting way to study places and history. It's been a joy to apply the hospitality mindset to software experiences. </p>
