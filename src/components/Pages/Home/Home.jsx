            <p>AppTree Software - Portland, OR</p>
            <p>
              I'm currently working for Enterprise SaaS company AppTree. I work on both the web client and the mobile app. This job is a blast because we're working in Dart with Flutter and Polymer. I'm the first employee hired solely for the Flutter team, where we're porting the app from native iOS and Android.  I spend most of my time implementing the front-end and UI.
