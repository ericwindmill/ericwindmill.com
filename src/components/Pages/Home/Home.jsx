            <h4>AppTree Software - Portland, OR</h4>
            <p>I'm currently working for Enterprise SaaS company AppTree. I work on both the web client and the mobile app. This job is a blast because we're working in Dart with Flutter and Polymer, so it's all new to me. I'm the first employee hired solely for the Flutter team, where we're porting the app from native iOS and Android.  I spend most of my time implementing the front-end and UI.</p>
